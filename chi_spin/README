instructions for running getqffchi.m:
-------------------------------------

this code calculates the frequency-dependent spin 
susceptibility in a plane wave basis, i.e. chi(q,G,G',w).

To run the code, you have to provide 4 files:

1) cd.dat (charge density in ascii from espresso scf calc)
2) gvecs.dat (obtained by running epsinvomega on BGW chimat file)
3) fulleps.dat (obtained by running epsinvomega on BGW chimat file)
4) nmtx.dat (contains number of Gvecs for all the qpoints)

Notes: 
------
1) to obtain cd.dat, do: 
iotk convert charge-density.dat charge-density.xml 
grep -v "<" charge-density.xml > cd.dat 

2) to obtain nmtx.dat, do:
grep nmtx out_bgw
with out_bgw being the bgw output file

Next, the file setup.m has to be modified:
1) you have modify the lattice tensor R (in a.u.)
2) you have to modify the FFT grid S (do grep FFT out on espresso scf out file)
